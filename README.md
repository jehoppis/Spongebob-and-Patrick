# Spongebob-and-Patrick
Here I set up a Convolutional Neural Network (using TensorFlow) to classify images based on whether they contain Spongebob or Patrick. The images are included, as I split them on my home computer, under arranged data. On my home computer, I achieved 85% accuracty on the images in /Spongebob and Patrick/arranged data/valid. The images were obtained from a google image search and downloaded one at a time to insure none of the images contained both Spongebob and Patrick, though many of them include other characters like Squidward. There are 200 images total, 100 Spongebob and 100 Patrick. I have them split 90/10 for training/testing.
